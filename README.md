Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-SOftware engineering is an engineering principle to design , develop, test and maintance of software.
importance
-SOftware engineering ensures software development of high quality prosucts.
-QUality assurance ensures there is no chances of any bugs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- development of high level languages like fortran, COBOL and C . this languages enbaled programmers to write code in a more abstract and human understandable langugaes 
- establishing software development as a discipline in the 1960's
- Advent of structured programming this aspect helped in breaking down softwares into smaller manageable modules using loops and conditions.
- introduction of agile methodologies. It emphasizies on iterative development approach that is flexible and allows collaborations unlike the rigid traditional processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-requirement analysis
this is the phase were you gather informayion likr functional and non functional requiremnts needed to understand the users need , what the system must do and issue to be considered
- Design
  A design is created this includes data structures, algorithms and mostly focus on system architecture
- Implementation(coding)
  This involves writing code based on the design documents.Developers create the software by by programming in the chosen languages.
- Testing
  The software undergoes various levels of testing to identify and fix bugs, verify that it meets the requirements and ensure it functions correctly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Structure: Waterfall is linear and structured, making it predictable but inflexible. Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for changes but with less predictability.
- Flexibility: Waterfall is best for projects with stable requirements, while Agile excels in environments where requirements are likely to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer
-THey write code and maintain the code that makes the software
Quality Assurance
Designing test plans and cases based on software requirements.THey perform various types of testing such as unit .THey also report bugs and issues experienced during testing
Project Manager(PM)
Does project planning and cordinating teams in the activities of software development .


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES
THey provide tools used in development process under one application.It improves the code quality and reduces errors in the code example is Visual studio Code 

Version Control
ALlows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time withou having any conflicts.It manages changes made by the different developers
IT also tracks changes made to the codebase. example is Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-systems can become extremely complex, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and extend them over time. As a system grows, interdependencies between components can lead to unintended consequences when changes are made
strategy :Break the system into smaller, self-contained modules or components. This reduces interdependencies and makes the system easier to understand and maintain.
- Engineers often face tight deadlines, leading to pressure to deliver quickly, which can compromise code quality, lead to burnout, or result in missed requirements.
STrategy:using Agile methodologies to break down the project into smaller, manageable sprints with clear goals. This allows for iterative development, better planning, and more frequent deliveries.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit 
-it involves testing individual components or unit of code to ensure each unit performs as expected in isolation from other parts of the system.

integration
-It tests integration between different components of software, it's goal is to find issues that arise when units are combined .

System
INvolves testing the entire system as a whole, if the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance
System is released to the end user to verfiy that the software meets the business requiremnts and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promt engineering is the process of desinging inputs to effectively communicate and extract desired output from AI models,
 importance
 - Production of quality feedback
 - good prompt engineering reduces the need for multiple iterations to get the desired response.
 - Prompt engineering often involves testing and refining prompts based on the outputs generated. This iterative process helps users better understand how the AI model interprets different inputs, leading to continuous improvement in interactions.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague
- "Tell me about software development."
  Improved Prompt:
-explain the key differences between Agile and Waterfall methodologies in software development.
the vague is too broad the improved one specifies exactly what aspect of software development is of interest
